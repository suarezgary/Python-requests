Python Post Requests with Requests library

Note: You need the python requests library and a server that answer http POST.

Requests is a library that helps you to make HTTP requests easier, I strongly recommend you to visit the official page For installation and documentation (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
If you just want to fast install and test your http server,  write the following line into your terminal window:
$ pip install requests
